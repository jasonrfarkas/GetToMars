		Colonizing Mars has long been a passion of Elon Musk. The entrepreneur has repeatedly said that he founded SpaceX in 2002 primarily to help 
		make humanity a multiplanet species. Having a self-sustaining outpost on the Red Planet would serve as an insurance policy, making humanity's extinction 
		unlikely even if something goes terribly awry here on Earth,
		</p>
		<p>
		Colonizing Mars would have other benefits as well, he added; the effort would greatly advance science discoveries and technological capabilities, 
		and it would help inspire and excite people from all walks of life and from all around the globe.
		</p>
		<p>You could say that sending people to Mars is 'the next giant leap for mankind'. This mission will jumpstart massive developments in all 
		kinds of areas, a few examples being in recycling, solar energy, food production and the advancement of medical technology.

		Colonizing Mars won't be easy, but humanity can do it with a few key technological advances, Elon Musk said. Chief among them are fully and rapidly 
		reusable rockets, and the ability to produce rocket propellant from local materials on the Red Planet.
		</p>
		<p>
		Permanent settlement allows Mars One to use technology that is not substantially different from existing systems. The hardware specifically needed for
		this mission still needs to be designed, built, and tested extensively but the technology already exists.Every effort was made to design the mission 
		with as little complexity as possible. The choice to send permanent settlers removes the need for a heavy lift launch vehicle, which does not currently 
		exist. Permanent settlement makes the landing module small enough to land with current technology. A pressurized rover will not be sent to Mars until 
		large enough rockets exists. No water recycling in the transit habitat will be present because the trip to Mars takes only 210 days. Instead, all required 
		water is stored in tanks that also function as radiation shielding. Storage of  waste that is not easily recycled is available in the settlement until more
		technology is available.

		<h3>
		Age

		<p>
		The astronaut selection program will be open for applicants who are 18 years or older. This is the age by which children become legal adults in most 
		countries in the world. Mars One believes it is important that applicants who enter the astronaut selection program are capable of entering into a legal 
		contract without the supervision of others.
		There is not an upper age limit to apply for the astronaut selection program. If the applicant enjoys good health and he or she has all the other 
		characteristics needed for the mission he or she has what it takes to apply.
