		Colonizing Mars has long been a passion of Elon Musk. The entrepreneur has repeatedly said that he founded SpaceX in 2002 primarily to help 
		make humanity a multiplanet species. Having a self-sustaining outpost on the Red Planet would serve as an insurance policy, making humanity's extinction 
		unlikely even if something goes terribly awry here on Earth,

		Colonizing Mars would have other benefits as well, he added; the effort would greatly advance science discoveries and technological capabilities, 
		and it would help inspire and excite people from all walks of life and from all around the globe.

		<p>You could say that sending people to Mars is 'the next giant leap for mankind'. This mission will jumpstart massive developments in all 
		kinds of areas, a few examples being in recycling, solar energy, food production and the advancement of medical technology.

		Colonizing Mars won't be easy, but humanity can do it with a few key technological advances, Elon Musk said. Chief among them are fully and rapidly 
		reusable rockets, and the ability to produce rocket propellant from local materials on the Red Planet.
		</p>
		<p>
		Permanent settlement allows Mars One to use technology that is not substantially different from existing systems. The hardware specifically needed for
		this mission still needs to be designed, built, and tested extensively but the technology already exists.
